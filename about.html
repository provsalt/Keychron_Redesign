          <p>
            Keychron was formed in 2017 by a group of keyboard enthusiasts who
            have extensive experience in keyboard manufacturing. The group
            consists of designers, marketers, and production experts. Our core
            team members, Will Ye has 9 years of experience in keyboard
            production and related businesses and Sven Zhu has 10 years of
            experience in industrial design. We dedicate ourselves to creating
            the most sophisticated mechanical keyboards with minimalist designs.
            <br class="mb-4" />
            Weâ€™ve partnered a factory with 20 years of experience, which
            produces top-notch keyboards for many well-known keyboard brands
            over the years. We can assure you that the Keychron keyboard will
            never fail you.
